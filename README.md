# TomatoTranslation
I wrote this app to machine-ly translate Tomato Adventure into ENGLISH.

If you haven't heard of it, it's a predecessor to the Mario & Luigi RPGs that was never localized.

All credit for data mining this game, and creating the script injecting tools, goes to Clyde Mandelin.
If you want to patch the game yourself, you'll need to download his tools, which can be found here:

The only thing I really did was write a quick app to translate a huge amount of japanese text to english through google's public translation API. I'm too lazy to look into licensing right now, so for now, all I'm going to be storing in this repository is this translation script.
